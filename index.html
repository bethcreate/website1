        <p>
            AkiraChix was founded in 2010 by a group of women who were passionate about changing the landscape of the<br>
             technology field and creating a community that supports, connects and inspires women in the tech<br>
              space. These young women challenged the status quo by encouraging and facilitating more women<br>
               to take up careers in technology-related fields. Its vision has continued to be led by Linda<br>
                Kamau and Marie Githinji, who have committed to champion the diversity and inclusion of<br>
                 women in the technical workforce, changing the economic capabilities of young women as<br>
                  well as shifting societal norms. AkiraChix has come a long way from its beginnings,<br>
                   where we trained young women from Nairobi in a bus fitted with computers, to a<br>
                    fully-fledged residential campus with a goal of serving young <br>
                    women from all over Kenya and other African Countries.<hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;color: purple;background-color: purple">
